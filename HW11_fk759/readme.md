All work in Assignment 1 completed by Francis Ko with some guidance from Jordan Vani.

Assignment 2 was worked on by Francis with extensive help from other CUSPers (most notably Hrafknell), who had completed the 
assignment earlier on the day that it was due since both of us took the one-time 2-day extension on HW due date offer. 
This assignment's difficulty was largely in getting the business data properly uploaded to PUIDATA, and I had to rely much on the
kindness of others in teaching me how to use the sklearn module.
