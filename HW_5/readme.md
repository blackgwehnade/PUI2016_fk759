I worked collaboratively with Shay Lehmann on Assignments 1 and 2, who helped tremendously in 
developing code to plot the income by gender data from U.S. Census. I then used Federica's skeleton notebooks for Assignment 2 as well as
her plotting notebook to complete the rest of Assignment 2.
Assignment 3 was completed on my own.
