Disclaimer: I had issues accessing the Compute environment until approximate Monday evening (11/14/2016) 
and as a result had to seek assistance from multiple parties this assignment.

I started this assignment with trouble being able to properly load the datacube using the Numpy module, 
at which point I promptly visited the teaching assistant, Himanshu Kumawat, who kindly assisted me in 
debugging why my machine could not read inMTA_Fare.npy using Numpy. We later found out that we had to add 
'?raw=true' to the end of the string when running the np.load() command.

I was able to complete the first phase of the assignment on my own, but then sought assistance from 
Anastasia Shegay and Victor Seppe Gripp and latter Jordan Vani for Phases 2 and 3.
