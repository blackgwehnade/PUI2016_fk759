Assignment 1, I had difficulty reading the CSV and shapefiles into dataframe on compute, so I visited
Sabreen (Thursday class TA) and she advised me to clone Federica's repo to my local computer and then manually
upload datafiles into my homework directory in compute.

After that point I was able to run Sina's notebook verbatum in my compute.

For Assignment 2, I worked with Richard Vecsler, who primarily helped me to split the dataframe from Monthly Average Rides 
into Summer and Winter dataframes. Once this occurred, I was able to complete the rest of the assignment solo.
