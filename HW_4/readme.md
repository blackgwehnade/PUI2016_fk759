For Assignment 1, I was assigned to review Hrafknell's submisison for Week 3, Assignment 2 null hypothesis testing. 
His null hypothesis was that there is no significant difference in purchasing of Citibike 24-hour passes on weekdays and weekends,
    while his alternative hypothesis was that there is a significant difference.
His independent variable was date (time), while the dependent was the number of passes purchased, split between male and female.
I recommended that he test his hypotheses using the t-test, and also supported the way he formulated his hypotheses.

In Assignment 2, I collaborated with Anastasia Shegay and Tashay Green in selecting the articles that would allow us to use two
    of the required statistical analysis tests, and Tashay did the majority of the structuring of the table.

For Assignments 3 and 4 I worked mostly alone with the code that Federica provided, but sought help from Kristi Korsberg in 
    Assignment 4 by locating and parsing the CSV file into a dataframe, which then allowed me to continue using Federica's code
    to conduct my three statistical tests.
