Throughout Assignments 1 and 2, I partnered with Shay and Jordan Vani. We began by ordering the bus tracking data key from the MTA and then began to define our variables. I decided to set my key as a string equal to 'bus_key' as a variable, and a variable for desired bus service as a raw input string. Then we used the professor's code to parse the data from the JSON file, and began to set our own variables. I decided to create a variable for URL, and then a variable for the number of active buses on the requested line. We worked together to create a for loop to iterate through each bus's data for latitude and longitude, then printing the results.

In Assignment 2, I then researched how to use sys.argv and the dataframe module together to first display the results of Assignment 1 in a pandas dataframe, then outputting the results to a CSV. Per the requirements, I added the StopPointName and PresentableDistance variables to the for loop from Assignment 1. 

For Assignment 3, Pooneh helped me figure out which modules to import (matplotlib.pyplot as plt, pylab inline etc.) and then Jordan Vani helped me to use the os.getenv command to find the CUSP url for my desired dataset (dealing with TLC licensing info). Then I created a series of nested functions to drop irrelevant columns and rows prior to plotting the remaining data using matplotlib. Richard Vecsler then assisted me in pushing the results from compute to Github.
