I worked on Assignment 1 and 2 with Jordan Vani and Tashay Green, the first of which we were able to complete mostly on our own.
Tashay provided us with moderate assistance in altering the code for plotting the binomial and ln distributions, which required a slightly different input in code.
We then worked collaboratively to parse the Citibike data for Assignment 2 and then graph our data of interest.
On Monday afternoon, I returned to CUSP to work with Adrian Dahlin (who recorded the population mean & distribution) to complete Assignment 3.
Enrique helped us both to push the assignments to Github.
