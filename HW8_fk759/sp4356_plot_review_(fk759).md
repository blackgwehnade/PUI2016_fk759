This plot is meant to display the relationship between the day of the week (independent variable) and number of rides taken on Citibike (dependent variable #1), as well as the average duration of each ride (dependent variable #2).

The plot is properly rendered and the axes are properly labeled, with number of rides per day represented on the y-axis. At first glance, the way the average speed of the ride is displayed (circles of varying size labeled by duration, so bigger numbers mean slower trips) is slightly confusing. The average trip duration also corresponds to circle size, with larger circles meaning longer/slower trips.

The title is mostly approppriate for what the plot represents, but I would label the title more specific e.g. 'Citibike ridership frequency and duration by day of week'. Also if feasible, it might be helpful to also have a graduated color scheme for the circles e.g. darker shade of purple for longer average trip duration.

Overall this is a well-done plot and does not require an extensive analysis of the code to understand what is being done.
