This plot clearly displays the title and labels for the x and y axes, as well as a legend with a clear color code. The labels in the legend are confusing though, as I do not understand what 'harm_M.X.M' is supposed to mean. Is it a frequency? I infer from the chart that certain songs have more intense cord changes throughout different parts of perhaps the frequency spectrum?

Aesthetic

I enjoyed the creativity in using a multi-segmented bar chart with each section distinguished by a different color in representing the cord changes by song. I am not music-versed enough to judge whether or not it makes sense to use the song names as the dependent variable label, but I am not troubled by it.

Overall the plot seems to represent an interesting musical phenomenon, but I am not sure exactly what that phenomenon is based on the plot labels in the legend. I would like for either the legend to more clearly spell out what is being represented by each color, or perhaps some footnotes to explain the legend labels. The plot also did not render within the notebook at first, so it took me some amount of time to run the code and do so.

Other than not being able to immediately render the plot and confusion over what is being measured, I would have to rate this a decent plot!
